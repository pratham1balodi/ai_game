## ðŸš€ What It Does

âœ… Accepts raw game code (e.g., player movement, object updates)  
âœ… Accepts a natural-language prompt for the improvement you want  
âœ… Returns an optimized or modified version of the code  
âœ… Explains changes clearly in human-readable language  
âœ… Shows a side-by-side diff before integrating suggestions  
âœ… Optional "Fast Mode" to trade depth for speed  
âœ… Runs entirely offline (no paid APIs, no OpenAI calls)  
âœ… Supports Google Colab + GPU acceleration

- **Smart AI + UX**: It doesnâ€™t just complete code â€” it *thinks about your goal*  
- **Friendly Explanation**: Meet "Pixie" â€” your code reviewer with attitude  
- **Real-world Integration**: Applies suggestions directly into existing code  
- **Performance Optimized**: Handles both CPU and GPU, with Fast Mode for demos  
- **Developer Experience**: Diff tools, syntax validation, memory-aware context
